# DS3002: Project 1
This project is a Shiny application that extracts, transforms, and loads a dataset from Spotify on a list of approximately 2000 songs. Some highlights of what it can do include generating a density plot of the popularity of a specific artist's discography and generating a list of most similar songs to a user-selected song.
